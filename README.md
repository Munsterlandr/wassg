# Wow, Another Static Site Generator (WASSG)
This project exists because of a gripe of mine with other SSGs: they abstract too much from the HTML. Instead of that, this one takes the opposite approach: everything is just HTML (or XML) with some extra code thrown in. Think of it more like a Preprocessor than a normal Static Site Generator.
